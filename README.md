# Nextstrain_Ecuador
This repository contains the epidemiological analysis of Ecuador using [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) to understand how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, evolves and spreads in Ecuador.

Full datasets (in fasta format and metadata) come from [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/) reviewed until April 29, 2021.

The Republic of Ecuador is divided into 24 Provinces which are divided into 221 Cantons (named location in this analysis). In Ecuador, the cantons and metropolitan districts are similar to municipalities in many countries.

## Bioinformatics notes

Site numbering and genome structure uses [Wuhan-Hu-1/2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) as reference. The phylogeny is rooted relative to early samples from Wuhan. Temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of [8 &times; 10^-4 subs per site per year](http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-176-genomes-6-mar-2020/356). There were SNPs present in the nCoV samples in the first and last few bases of the alignment that were masked as likely sequencing artifacts.
